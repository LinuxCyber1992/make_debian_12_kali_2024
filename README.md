I don't recommend you to install kali-linux-everything on this project.
It has errors. This was intended for default tools or top 10 tools in Kali.
Besides, you don't need all the tools in Kali, you are not going to use all of
it, unless you are an experienced penetration tester. If you do decide to install
more tools, then you can manually install each one in the kali repository:

https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/


If you are installing it with VMWare or Bare Metal
Please Choose:
NOTEPAD++OR_VSCODE_READ_ME_FOR_LINUX&WINDOWS.txt


If you are installing it in Mac
Please Choose:
NOTEPAD++OR_VSCODE_READ_ME_FOR_MAC.txt

READ the instructions carefully, thank you.

I don't recommend installing kali-linux-everything for this project. It is going
to take around 90GB - 110 GB and you really don't need a lot of tools that you're
not going to use, unless you already know a lot of Kali. Installing 
Kali-everything will get you errors.

Please make snapshots before you make changes in VMware, Qemu and Virtualbox.
Debian distros are best used with VMWare and ProxMox, in my opinion.
