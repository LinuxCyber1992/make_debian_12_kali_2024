If you are installing it with VMWare or Bare Metal
Please Choose:
NOTEPAD++OR_VSCODE_READ_ME_FOR_LINUX&WINDOWS.txt


If you are installing it in Mac
Please Choose:

READ the instructions carefully, thank you.
Disclaimer:
I am not responsible if you are doing illegal activities with Kali Linux

I don't recommend installing kali-linux-everything for this project. It is going
to take around 90GB - 110 GB and you really don't need a lot of tools that you're
not going to use, unless you already know a lot of Kali. Installing 
Kali-everything will get you errors.

Please make snapshots before you make changes in VMware, Qemu and Virtualbox.
Debian distros are best used with VMWare and ProxMox, in my opinion.
Enjoy!
